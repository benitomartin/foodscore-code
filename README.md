# **THE BUSINESS MODEL**

## **Pain Points**

Food recognition using deep learning models has become an active research area in recent years. 
However, there are still several pain points that researchers and developers need to address in order to improve the performance of these models. Here are some of them:

- <ins>Limited availability and quality of food datasets</ins>: Collecting and labeling large-scale datasets of diverse food images is time-consuming, expensive, and requires a lot of effort, which makes it challenging to train models that generalize well to unseen data.

- <ins>Variability in food appearance</ins>: Food can vary widely in appearance. This variability can lead to challenges in developing accurate models that can recognize different types of food.

- <ins>Overlapping of food items</ins>: In real-world images, food items may overlap or be partially occluded by other objects, which make it difficult for deep learning models to accurately recognize them and their boundaries.

- <ins>Computational complexity</ins>: Deep learning models for food recognition typically require large amounts of computational resources and processing power, which can be expensive and time-consuming.

## **The Idea**

Worldwide overweight in the adult population has increased from 39% to 45% in the past 5 years and a healthy diet prevents overweight and related health problems. Additionally, the Europe Diet and Nutrition Apps Market is expected to account for USD 4,580 Million by 2028. With these insights, developing a model to classify a food item within an image and return its nutrition data will help to track our diet's nutritional composition. 

## **The Data**

For this project the Dataset [Food100](http://foodcam.mobi/dataset100.html) from the Food Recognition Research Group (University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan) was used. This Dataset contains a mixture of western and japanese food, 100 different classes and around 12740 photos including 1174 multiple-food photos.
