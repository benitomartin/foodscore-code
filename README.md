## **Pain Points**

Food recognition using deep learning models has become an active research area in recent years. 
However, there are still several pain points that researchers and developers need to address in order to improve the performance of these models. 
Here are some of these main pain points:

- <ins>Limited availability and quality of food datasets</ins>: Collecting and labeling large-scale datasets of diverse food images is time-consuming, expensive, and requires a lot of effort, 
which makes it challenging to train models that generalize well to unseen data.

- <ins>Variability in food appearance</ins>: Food can vary widely in appearance. This variability can lead to challenges in developing accurate models that can recognize different types of food.
