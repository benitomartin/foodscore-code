## :pushpin: **Pain Points**

Food recognition using deep learning models has become an active research area in recent years. 
However, there are still several pain points that researchers and developers need to address in order to improve the performance of these models. Here are some of them:

- <ins>Limited availability and quality of food datasets</ins>: Collecting and labeling large-scale datasets of diverse food images is time-consuming, expensive, and requires a lot of effort, which makes it challenging to train models that generalize well to unseen data.

- <ins>Variability in food appearance</ins>: Food can vary widely in appearance. This variability can lead to challenges in developing accurate models that can recognize different types of food.

- <ins>Overlapping of food items</ins>: In real-world images, food items may overlap or be partially occluded by other objects, which make it difficult for deep learning models to accurately recognize them and their boundaries.

- <ins>Computational complexity</ins>: Deep learning models for food recognition typically require large amounts of computational resources and processing power, which can be expensive and time-consuming.

## :thinking: **The Idea**

Worldwide overweight in the adult population has increased from 39% to 45% in the past 5 years and a healthy diet prevents overweight and related health problems. Additionally, the Europe Diet and Nutrition Apps Market is expected to account for USD 4,580 Million by 2028. With these insights, developing a model to classify a food item within an image and return its nutrition data will help to track our diet's nutritional composition. 

## :rice: **The Data**

For this project, the Dataset [Food100](http://foodcam.mobi/dataset100.html) from the Food Recognition Research Group (University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan) was used. This Dataset contains a mixture of Western and Japanese food, 100 different classes and around 12740 photos, including 1174 multiple-food photos.

Additionally, the nutrition facts were extracted from the database [FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html)
 of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
 
## :atom: **The Model**

#### :one: **Data Preparation**

The dataset is well organized, and it can be easily split into train, validation and test set using `image_dataset_from_directory`.

#### :two: **Data Augmentation**

Due to some unbalanced classes, data augmentation was implemented. The following layers from Tensorflow Keras were used:
- `RandomFlip`
- `RandomRotation`
- `RandomBrightness`
- `RandomContrast`
- `RandomZoom`

Additionally, a layer called `RandomBlurHue` was created to adjust the color hue of RGB images by a random factor and perform Gaussian blur on the images.

#### :three: **Data Training and Evaluation**

Transfer learning using `ResNet152`was implemented. This model has convolutional weights that are trained on ImageNet data, and compared to the other Keras Models, it was the model with the best performance.


#### :four: **Deployment**

For deployment, the following steps were followed:

ðŸ‘‰ create a prediction API using FastAPI

ðŸ‘‰ create a Docker image containing the environment required to run the code of our API

ðŸ‘‰ push this image to Google Cloud Run so that it runs inside a Docker container that allow people all over the world to use it

## :clapper: **The Website**

The Website was created using streamlit and for that, an additional [repository](https://github.com/benitomartin/foodscore-app) was created. Instruction on how to use the Website can be found in that repository
